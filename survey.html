        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <p class = "intro_survey">
            Faces representing each of the 5 love styles. Each person’s childhood experiences form the roots of who they are; continuing to inform the way that person responds to others or expresses love, even far into adulthood. 
            The result of all these experiences are actually very predictable because people tend to fall into one of five special categories: called “Love Styles”.  
            This quiz will score you in each of the five Love Style categories, with a high score in any category signaling a trouble area. While most people will have a single, dominant Love Style, it is possible for you to have multiple problem areas. Don’t worry, at the end of the quiz we’ll explain your results and provide you with some next steps to begin your emotional recovery.
